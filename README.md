## Basics about me
- My name is Alex Chapa and I am a 21 year old CS student attending the University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley
## About Me
After graduating, I hope to earn a B.S. degree in Computer Science and apply my knowledge to the world of robotics or AI and inspire change one line of code at a time.  Aside from school, in my day to day, I will usually spend time travelling, playing my guitar, playing video games, cooking, working out, reading comics, and hosting Star Wars board game compeititons.
